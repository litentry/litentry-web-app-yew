# Litentry Web Application

As a device manager with lots of tokens published, it is better to control all the permissions and authorizations through a web app. Thus we are also planning to develop a web app based on React, which will give the user more possibilities to control the identities.

## Deploy

First, need `cargo-web`

```
cargo install cargo-web
```

Second, enter project directory, and do booting start

```
cargo web start
```

then, just visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in browser.
